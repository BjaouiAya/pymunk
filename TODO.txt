v5.x
----
- use twine to upload to Pypi? https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine
- use travis ci to build osx chipmunk lib file and run tests? https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/osx-ci-environment/
- Think about experimental repr of Body
- Get inspiration of examples and debug drawing from here: https://github.com/liabru/matter-js  
- add better example benchmark for threaded solver
- automatic test build of android apk on travis 
- cleanup implementation of autoexample sphinx extension
- pickle: fix shape id 
- make example of good timestep handling
- update most example code to use shape.density or shape.mass instead of 
  body.mass and moment.
- maybe it would be good to use pip install pymunk[docs] or something to distribute docs and exmaples?
- can autosummary be used? (see stackoverflow answer)
- update doctests to use python3 print instead of python2.

v6+ (all potentially breaking changes)
---
- Remake BB into namedtuple
- Think about split between pymunk.util and pymunk modules
- do we still need pymunk.inf? Yes, for body with normal mass but infinite 
  moment.
- make shape.sensor return bool instead of int
- Think about overriding behavior of sensor shapes in segment and point_query 
  vs segment_first and point_query_nearest (one hits sensors the other does not)
- Think about return tuple of doubles instead of Vec2d in autogeometry module.
  Skipping the Vec2d can potentially lead to big saving (2x speedup in one 
  microbench). 
- Make add_collision_handler(a,b) and add_collision_handler(b,a) return the 
  same handler. Fixes https://github.com/viblo/pymunk/issues/132
